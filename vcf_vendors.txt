Educating visitors through hands-on exhibits at the RTF Museum (RTFM) in Watertown, CT is just one piece of the puzzle - RTF has created an online database where users can find valuable resources about their retro tech, as well as track their own inventory and quickly and easily source repair parts. RTF also holds the North America’s most complete Apple Computer collection."
