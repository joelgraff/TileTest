Revised Implementation Plan
Phase 1A: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
Goal: Working prototype with 1 quest type, minimal assets

Create DomainManager.js

Load technology_domains.json
Map vendors to domains
Provide domain-based data access
Create QuestManager.js

Implement 1 quest type (e.g., "Barter" - simplest)
Basic quest generation from domain templates
Quest completion detection
Extend UIManager

Add basic quest log (text list)
Quest completion notifications
Create technology_domains.json

Define 4-5 core domains (commodore, apple, gaming, electronics, calculators)
Simple quest templates for chosen type
Phase 1B: Second Quest Type (1-2 weeks)
Goal: Test quest combination feasibility

Add second quest type (e.g., "Investigate")
Test domain-based quest solving
Refine UI based on testing
Phase 2: Core Features (3-4 weeks)
Goal: Full quest system with state persistence

Implement SessionManager.js

Cookie-based state storage/loading
Quest progress persistence
Vendor session management
Add remaining quest types

Assembly/Repair, Logic/Riddle, etc.
Quest combination logic
Enhanced UI

Progress indicators
Quest rewards display
Concurrent quest limits
Phase 3: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
Goal: Map integration and polish

Map quest objects

Interactive quest triggers
Hidden items for "Investigate" quests
Quest chain logic

Multi-step quest sequences
Dependency resolution
Phase 4: Polish (1-2 weeks)
Goal: Production-ready experience

Quest difficulty scaling
Reward system integration
Performance optimization
Comprehensive testing
Key Advantages of Revised Approach
Scalable: Start with 1 quest type, expand incrementally
Testable: Domain-based system allows isolated testing
Maintainable: Clear separation between vendor data and quest logic
Flexible: Easy to add new domains or quest types
Performant: Limited active vendor set reduces computational load
Success Metrics
Phase 1: 1-2 quest types working with basic UI
Phase 2: Full quest system with 4+ types and state persistence
Phase 3: Map-integrated quests with advanced features
Phase 4: Polished, production-ready quest system
