To develop a JavaScript-based game like "VCF Quest" that adapts to yearly changes in vendors and floor plans, we'd need a structured set of details across design, technical, and data aspects. This ensures the game is modular, maintainable, and easy to update without rewriting core code. Below, I'll outline the key categories of necessary details, focusing on what's essential for implementation.

### 1. **Game Design and Mechanics**
   - **Core Objective and Storyline:** A high-level narrative, such as "Explore the Vintage Computer Festival (VCF) expo as a retro enthusiast, collecting artifacts from vendors to build the ultimate vintage setup and 'unlock' the Discovery Door." Specify win/lose conditions, like completing collections within a time limit or avoiding "overcrowding" penalties.
   - **Player Controls and Movement:** Top-down 8-bit style implies grid-based movement (e.g., arrow keys or WASD for navigation). Details on collision detection (walls, booths), pathfinding (to handle winding paths like in the floor plan), and interactions (e.g., pressing space to talk to vendors or examine items).
   - **Interactions and Events:** 
     - Vendor encounters: Dialog trees, trading systems, or mini-games (e.g., a trivia quiz on booth labels like combining "A" and "E" for an Apple clue).
     - Obstacles: Dynamic elements like moving "crowd" NPCs, puzzles (e.g., decoding booth numbers to open paths), or random events (e.g., "power outage" in certain zones).
     - Inventory System: How players collect and manage artifacts (e.g., limited slots, combining items).
   - **Progression and Levels:** Since the map is the "level," define zones (A-Z booths as themed areas) and progression gates (e.g., need items from early booths to access later ones). Include side quests or Easter eggs tied to real VCF history.
   - **Difficulty and Replayability:** Scaling options (easy mode with hints, hard mode with timers) and randomization (e.g., vendor item placements shuffle slightly each playthrough).

### 2. **Map and Layout Data**
   - **Dynamic Map Format:** Represent the floor plan as data that can be loaded externally. Use a JSON or tilemap format (e.g., from Tiled editor) with:
     - Grid dimensions (e.g., based on the provided plan's scale, like 30x20 tiles).
     - Tile types: Walkable paths, walls, entrances/exits, booth positions (labeled A-Z).
     - Special markers: Dining area as a hub, emergency exits as teleports, or "System Source X" as a boss zone.
     - Yearly Updates: A new JSON file per year, with booth coordinates, sizes (e.g., 24x8 for booth E), and connections (to handle layout changes).
   - **Path and Navigation Logic:** Algorithms for shortest paths between booths (e.g., A* for AI NPCs) and visibility (e.g., fog of war to reveal the map as explored).
   - **Scalability:** Handle varying expo sizes (e.g., more booths in future years) by making the map loader flexible, with auto-scaling for different screen sizes.

### 3. **Vendor and Content Data**
   - **Vendor List Format:** A configurable JSON array for each year, including:
     - Booth assignment (e.g., { "booth": "A", "vendorName": "RetroTech Inc.", "description": "Sells vintage Apple parts" }).
     - Items/Artifacts: List of collectibles per vendor (e.g., { "item": "Commodore 64", "clue": "Found in booth C", "value": 10 points }).
     - Interactions: Predefined dialogs, trades, or puzzles tied to the vendor.
   - **Dynamic Loading:** Code to fetch or import this data at runtime (e.g., from a server or local file), allowing easy swaps for new years without redeploying the game.
   - **Theming:** Tie vendors to real VCF elements, like historical computers or sponsors, but ensure placeholders for changes (e.g., generic "Vendor X" if details are TBD).

### 4. **Technical Implementation Details**
   - **JavaScript Framework/Library:** Choose one for efficiency:
     - Phaser.js (ideal for 2D games, handles tilemaps, physics, and animations out-of-the-box).
     - Plain Canvas/WebGL for a lightweight approach, or PixiJS for rendering if focusing on pixel art.
     - Reasons: These support browser compatibility, mobile touch controls, and easy asset loading.
   - **Asset Requirements:**
     - Graphics: 8-bit pixel art tileset (e.g., 16x16 tiles for floors, walls, booths) and sprites (player character, NPCs, items). Tools like Aseprite for creation; need ~50-100 assets initially.
     - Audio: Chiptune soundtrack (e.g., .ogg files for background music, sound effects for interactions). Use libraries like Howler.js for playback.
     - Loading System: Preloader for assets to handle different yearly themes (e.g., new sprites for updated vendors).
   - **Code Structure:**
     - Modular setup: Separate files for map loader, player controller, UI (inventory, score), and event handlers.
     - State Management: Use a game loop with states (e.g., exploring, dialog, mini-game) via finite state machines.
     - Saving/Loading: LocalStorage for progress, especially if the game spans multiple sessions.
   - **Performance and Compatibility:** Target modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox); optimize for low-end devices (e.g., limit particles). Test for resolutions from desktop to mobile.

### 5. **User Interface and Experience**
   - **UI Elements:** HUD for inventory, map mini-view, score, and hints. Dialog boxes for vendor talks, with text typing effects for retro feel.
   - **Accessibility:** Keyboard/mouse/touch support, color-blind modes, and adjustable text sizes.
   - **Monetization/Integration:** If tied to VCF, details on embedding (e.g., as a web app on the event site) or sharing (e.g., itch.io export).

### 6. **Development and Maintenance Considerations**
   - **Tools and Workflow:** Version control (Git), build tools (Webpack for bundling), and testing frameworks (Jest for unit tests on mechanics).
   - **Team/Resources:** Estimated effort (e.g., 1-2 developers for a prototype in 2-4 weeks; artists for assets).
   - **Legal/Ethical:** Permissions for using VCF branding, vendor names, or real floor plans; ensure data privacy if loading from servers.
   - **Testing and Iteration:** Playtesting scenarios for different maps/vendors, bug fixes for path collisions, and feedback loops for yearly updates.

With these details, you could start prototyping by creating a sample JSON map based on the attached floor plan and a basic Phaser setup. If you provide specifics like preferred libraries or sample data, I can help refine or even sketch code snippets!
